# Cats-Dogs-Classifier

A project based on Chapter Four of [Modern Computer Vision with Pytorch]. Create a Convolutional Neural Network in Pytorch classifying images of dogs and cats from [Kaggle].
Example Training Images:

![cat 1](https://github.com/aristosp/Cats-Dogs-Classifier/assets/62808962/7442d848-ab19-4ccf-9254-0fc0467388ff) ![dog 4](https://github.com/aristosp/Cats-Dogs-Classifier/assets/62808962/60451cac-5fe7-49b6-ae70-b456b70021b0)

The training dataset contains 4000 images of each pet, while the test dataset contains 1000 images of each. Images vary in size, so they are all resized to 224 x 224 and are used as RGB.
